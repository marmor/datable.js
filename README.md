![DaTableJS](http://netmask.it/DaTable.jpg)

Easy and powerful full-stack Javascript framework, based on tables, with a built-in support for temporal data, automatic undo-redo, versioning, and dozens of out-of-the-box features. Almost everything can be done through its web interface, which is based on itself...

The framework is inspired by an old framework, that was developed before I knew it was called "framework".
The new framework is open (rather than close as the old one),
based on Node (rather than Apache as the old one),
coded in Javascript on both sides (the old one used JS only on the client side, and C on the server side),
and suitable to modern standards,
but yet easy and powerful as the old framework.
